# How to transfer cryptocurrency from an exchange to a Trezor hardware wallet

Have you recently bought your first Trezor hardware wallet? Congratulations, it is now time to move your funds from an exchange to your Trezor.

> :warning: **Important notes**
> 
> - Make sure that the cryptocurrency you want to transfer is [supported by Trezor](https://trezor.io/coins).
> - Make sure that you you send the same cryptocurrency that you expect to receive. For example, if you expect to receive BTC (Bitcoin), but you send BCH (Bitcoin Cash), your funds may be lost.
> - Be careful what network you select. Some exchanges allow you to select alternative networks for withdrawal which may offer faster processing times and lower fees. Make sure to always select the same network as the one which you use to withdraw funds. **Using any other network may result in a loss of funds**.

Before you can transfer any cryptocurrency, make sure that you have already set up you new Trezor wallet. If not, you can check the following video:
