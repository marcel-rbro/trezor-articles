# SLIP39 and its implementation on Trezor wallets

SLIP39, or Shamir's Secret Sharing for Mnemonic Codes, is a cryptographic protocol that splits a cryptocurrency wallet's recovery seed into multiple shares for secure distribution. To restore the wallet, a predefined minimum number of these shares must be combined, enhancing both security and recoverability. It is used in Trezor hardware wallets to provide flexible, customizable, and resilient backup solutions.
